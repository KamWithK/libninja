      summary: Retrieve identity match score
      description: |-
        The `/processor/identity/match` endpoint generates a match score, which indicates how well the provided identity data matches the identity information on file with the account holder's financial institution.
        
        Fields within the `balances` object will always be null when retrieved by `/identity/match`. Instead, use the free `/accounts/get` endpoint to request balance cached data, or `/accounts/balance/get` for real-time data.
        
        This request may take some time to complete if Identity was not specified as an initial product when creating the Item. This is because Plaid must communicate directly with the institution to retrieve the data.
